<p>
  Play is a minimalistic sans serif typeface designed by Jonas Hecksher, Type Director of<a href="http://www.playtype.com">Playtype&acirc;&bdquo;&cent; Type Foundry</a>. All letters in Play derive from the 'O' &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; square and circular at the same time. Play is designed with large, open counters, ample lowercase x-heights and a corporate, yet friendly appearance. The combination of these qualities give Play both a high legibility and readability.
